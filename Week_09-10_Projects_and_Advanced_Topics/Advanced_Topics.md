# Advanced Topics in Python: Lesson Plan

## Objective
This lesson plan explores advanced Python topics to deepen your understanding and prepare you for real-world applications. Each lesson introduces a new concept, provides practical examples, and includes exercises.

---

## Lesson 1: Iterators and Generators
- **Concepts**: What iterators and generators are, and how they differ.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  # Iterator example
  my_list = [1, 2, 3]
  my_iter = iter(my_list)
  print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 1

  # Generator example
  def my_generator():
      for i in range(3):
          yield i
  gen = my_generator()
  print(next(gen))  # Output: 0
  ```
- **Exercises**: Write a generator to produce an infinite sequence of even numbers.

---

## Lesson 2: Decorators
- **Concepts**: What decorators are and how to use them.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  def decorator(func):
      def wrapper():
          print("Before the function call")
          func()
          print("After the function call")
      return wrapper

  @decorator
  def say_hello():
      print("Hello!")

  say_hello()
  ```
- **Exercises**: Create a decorator that times the execution of a function.

---

## Lesson 3: Context Managers
- **Concepts**: Managing resources using `with` statements.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
      file.write("Hello, world!")
  ```
- **Exercises**: Write a custom context manager to manage a database connection.

---

## Lesson 4: Regular Expressions
- **Concepts**: Pattern matching using the `re` module.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  import re
  text = "The price is $20."
  match = re.search(r"\$\d+", text)
  print(match.group())  # Output: $20
  ```
- **Exercises**: Extract all email addresses from a block of text.

---

## Lesson 5: Advanced List Comprehensions
- **Concepts**: Nested and conditional comprehensions.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
  flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
  print(flattened)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```
- **Exercises**: Create a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 20.

---

## Lesson 6: Multithreading and Multiprocessing
- **Concepts**: Parallel programming in Python.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  import threading

  def print_numbers():
      for i in range(5):
          print(i)

  thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
  thread.start()
  ```
- **Exercises**: Create a program that downloads multiple web pages concurrently.

---

## Lesson 7: Advanced File Handling
- **Concepts**: Working with JSON, CSV, and binary files.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  import json
  data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
  with open("data.json", "w") as file:
      json.dump(data, file)
  ```
- **Exercises**: Write a program to merge multiple CSV files into one.

---

## Lesson 8: Exception Handling Best Practices
- **Concepts**: Custom exceptions and logging errors.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  class CustomError(Exception):
      pass

  try:
      raise CustomError("An error occurred!")
  except CustomError as e:
      print(e)
  ```
- **Exercises**: Create a custom exception for invalid user input.

---

## Lesson 9: Python Libraries for Data Science
- **Concepts**: Overview of NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  data = pd.DataFrame({"Name": ["Alice", "Bob"], "Age": [25, 30]})
  print(data)
  ```
- **Exercises**: Use Matplotlib to create a bar chart from a dataset.

---

## Lesson 10: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
- **Concepts**: Inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

  class Animal(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def make_sound(self):
          pass

  class Dog(Animal):
      def make_sound(self):
          return "Woof!"

  dog = Dog()
  print(dog.make_sound())
  ```
- **Exercises**: Create a class hierarchy for vehicles with common methods like `start()` and `stop()`.

---

## Homework
1. **Iterators**: Implement a class-based iterator to generate Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Regex**: Write a script to validate phone numbers and email addresses.
3. **Threading**: Create a multithreaded program to read multiple files concurrently.
4. **OOP**: Design a library management system with classes for books, members, and transactions.
